## Overview
This project implements a hand-coded Senior Projects page using Flask. It includes:
- Static pages styled with CSS
- A responsive navigation menu
- Form submission handling with Flask
- Dynamic display of form results

## What is Flask?

Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications. It handles HTTP requests and responses, allows you to use templates for HTML, and serves static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images. Flask is flexible and minimal, so you can organize your project simply without extra setup.  

In this project, Flask is used to:

1. Serve the Senior Projects web pages from the `templates/` folder.
2. Handle form submissions and display results dynamically.
3. Serve static files like CSS, images, and JavaScript from the `static/` folder.

For more information, see the official Flask documentation: [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
